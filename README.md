# Credit-Card-Anomaly-Detection
The goal of this project is to detect anomalous transactions in a dataset of financial transactions. An anomalous transaction is one that deviates significantly from the typical behavior of other transactions in the dataset. We aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify anomalous transactions.
